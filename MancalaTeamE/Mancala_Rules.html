    <h1>The Rules</h1>
    <ul class="w3-ul w3-white w3-card-4">
      <li>
        <p class=""> Your bins are the lowest set (shown here in white)
          and numbered 1 - 6 in the diagram above. Your opponent's bins are numbered 7 - 12. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class=""> The large bins on the left and right sides of the board are called
            Mancalas: you score by moving stones into your Mancala</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class=""> The game starts with 4 stones in each bin numbered 1 - 12</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class=""> The first player is randomly chosen (either you or the computer)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="">When it's your turn to move, select one of your bins by clicking on it: this will
              empty that well and, moving counterclockwise, deposit one stone in each well (including your Mancala, but not your opponent's)</p>
              <ul class="w3-ul w3-card-4">
                <li>
                  <p class=""> If the last stone lands in your Mancala, you get another turn </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p class=""> If there are enough stones in the selected well to go all the way around
                    the board, the original well will be skipped </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p class=""> At the end of the turn, the seleted well will always be empty </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class=""> You can never move a stone into your opponent's Mancala: it will be skipped over </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class=""> If the last stone in a play is placed in an empty bin on your side of the board,
                  all of the stones in your opponentâ€™s bin that is directly opposite (as well as the stone placed in the
                  last bin) move to your Mancala </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p class=""> The game ends when one player's bins are all empty: the other player then captures all
                    the remaining stones on their side and moves them into their Mancala. The player with the most
                    stones in their Mancala at the end of the game wins</p>
                  </li>
